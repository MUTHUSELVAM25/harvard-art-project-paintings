Four inscriptions fill the empty spaces that once surrounded the painted imagery: two by Japanese statesmen who held high-level positions during the period of Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945); one by a Korean scholar and patron of the arts; the fourth by the artist, Kim Ŭng-wŏn, who inscribed and signed the painting with his sobriquet in the void between the rock and the dangling orchid leaves. The precise circumstances under which this painting was done and inscribed is unknown, but the presence of an calligraphed title by Count Terauchi Masatake (1852-1919), Governor-General of Korea between 1916 and 1919, would imply this was painted at a special gathering that took place some time during his term.

In both China and Korea, scholars embraced the orchid as the perfect emblem of the Confucian gentleman, as indicated by this painting’s inscribed title. The orchid points to the gentleman’s elegant, learned manner, the rock to his unwavering, upright character; the combination of orchid and rock symbolizes the Confucian gentleman’s erudition, cultivation, loyalty, and personal integrity. In addition, the orchid held a fascination for literati painters because its grass-like leaves and simple, delicate flowers lent themselves to depiction with calligraphic brushwork. From an aesthetic point of view, Chinese and Korean painters delighted in pairing orchids and rocks, the orchids coaxing the artist to employ his most delicate, flowing, curvilinear brushstrokes, the rocks tempting him to present his most forceful, expressionistic brushwork.

Chinese artists began to paint orchids during the Song dynasty (960–1279), the subject becoming ever more popular in the succeeding Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties. By the seventeenth century the taste for paintings of orchids had spread to Korea, where such works enjoyed considerable vogue in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries.",Paintings,2015.0,Gift

149492,Portrait of a Youth,Persian,Qajar period,19th century,Opaque watercolor on paper,23.8 x 14.2 cm (9 3/8 x 5 9/16 in.),Department of Islamic & Later Indian Art,"The composition of this portrait study was first outlined in pencil and then blocked out with fields of watercolor, as is evidenced in the sitter’s chair. Next, the artist added opaque watercolor in layers, using fine lines and stippling to replicate the designs and textures of fabrics, most prominently those of the young man’s patterned coat and its gray fur trim. In contrast to his brightly colored clothing, his face is generally pallid, but blues beneath his chin and mouth suggest the hint of a beard. The play on near monochrome is continued in the silhouetted, inky locks that frame his face and give way to a tall black hat. The subject’s position in the composition and aspects of painterly execution such as the modeling of his face and hands suggest that the image was based at least in part on a photograph, a practice common among Qajar artists from the mid-nineteenth century onward, photography having been introduced in Iran in the 1840s. The painting reflects the “new realism” introduced by Abu'l-Hasan Ghaffari, also known as Sani' al-Mulk, in the middle years of the nineteenth century, during the reign of Nasir al-Din Shah (r. 1848–96), and disseminated by his contemporaries. Ghaffari’s work combined physiognomic likeness with the psychology of the subject to produce an often intense pictorial effect—a “real” presence—undiminished by rich decorative details, which in some artists’ hands might emphasize surface at the expense of illusionistic volume and depth. Although this portrait lacks the overall impact of a work by Ghaffari, it demonstrates its painter’s participation in what was new at the time.
On the lower right side of the sheet, a barely visible inscription, which reads, tasvvr-i dukhtar-i Shahrukh (depiction [by] the daughter of Shahrukh), is tantalizing because it suggests a female artist.

167925,Red Painting,American,,20th century,Acrylic and linen on stretcher,243.2 x 180.7 cm (95 3/4 x 71 1/8 in.),Department of Modern & Contemporary Art,"The painting is a large, vertical plane of deep mahogany red-brown acrylic, painted in two distinct layers of thick and thinly applied acrylic, beginning with a stain of dark, ""Benzimidazo"" brown, which acts as a primer. Its outer surface of ""Azoic plum brown"" appears tactile and shiny, almost sticky. The layers vary visibly in tonality and density and the plum brown surface begins to gather into extended drips that coalesce in a series of parallel rivulets about halfway down the picture plane; towards the bottom center, it pools into a series of more marked gullies and ridges, pulling apart like a painterly fjord, and lifting, like a skirt, to reveal the stain below. The acrylic also shrinks in along some of the edges, gaining thickness as it does so, and these effects, along with the implied flow of the medium , the ""breathing room"" between the layers, and its orientation and scale, serve to give the painting an anthropomorphic, object quality. The painting entreats one to interact with it as a whole object/image, and not as a picture of assorted forms or things or parts; it also gains considerably when viewed in daylight. The title, ""Red Painting 1999 No. 4"", 1999, refers to the fact that this is the fourthpainting executed by Marioni in 1999. It is part of a set of four paintings executed in anticipation of the Fogg’s selection of one, and intended to ""show the range of Marioni’s approaches to his monochromes.""",Paintings,1999.0,Gift

mounting, including cord and roller ends: H. 122.5 x W. 61.5 cm (48 1/4 x 24 3/16 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"Because it blooms in winter, even before it dons its leaves and while snow and ice still cover the ground, the Chinese flowering plum (Prunus mume) became a symbol of purity and of strength in the face of adversity; as such, it was popular as both a literary and an artistic motif in China, Korea, and Japan. The plum, together with the orchid, the chrysanthemum, and the bamboo (three other botanical subjects imbued with symbolic Confucian meaning and conducive to depiction with a calligraphy brush and ink), came to be known as the ""Four Gentlemen.""

In this delicately rendered painting, the old blossoming plum tree appears almost as if enveloped in mist and shrouded in silvery moonlight. Unlike the rugged, expressive ink plum paintings by Cho Hŭi-ryong (1791-1859), the emphasis in this work is on suggestive description and delicate brushwork-characteristics typical of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Korean paintings of plum blossoms.

The wear and slight damage along the right edge of this painting, combined with absence of damage along the left vertical edge, suggest that it was once part of a folding screen. In that context, it is possible that the painting was salvaged from a damaged screen and subsequently mounted as a hanging scroll. One can imagine that the painting originally was one of six or eight panels, each of which represented an old plum tree.

The artist applies the gesso ground around the outer edges of the stretcher, so that the painted surface appears to be floating on a smooth white porcelain block. He applies color in thin layers of glaze, like so many veils. As many as 40 layers of glaze are built up over a period of several weeks. Laying down even, continuous brushstrokes in alternating layers of vertical and horizontal orientations, he creates a subtle grid pattern. The artist often applies one or more colors in addition to blue -- in this case, 6-8 layers of cinnabar green at different depths (traces of which can be seen around the edges of the painting). Layers of ultramarine in combination with royal blue (a mixture of ultramarine and titanium white) make the other colors vibrate, acting ""as a catalyst to bring the involved colors into spacious movement on the top of the surface."" (See artist's statement in object file.) The surface texture is purely the result of brushwork, which creates a structural discipline that interacts with the expansive dematerialized sensuality of blue.

screen mounting: H. 225 x W. 459.6 cm (88 9/16 x 180 15/16 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"A royal prince, Yi Ha-ŭng was the father of King Ko-chong (r. 1864-1906), the last king of the Chosŏn dynasty (1392-1910). In addition to being an enlightened statesman, Yi was an accomplished painter and calligrapher who was unsurpassed in his mastery of orchid painting. Frequently depicted in literati paintings alongside rocks and boulders, the orchid appears graceful, elegant, and unaffected by its rough surroundings. The orchids and rocks in Yi's paintings typically enter the composition at dramatic angles and generally occupy only one corner or one side of a composition. 

Korean folding screens often have six panels, like those painted in Japan; more characteristically, however, Korean screens boast eight, ten, or even twelve panels. In some cases, a Korean screen may feature a single, unified composition that spreads across all its panels; in other instances--such as this one--each panel is conceived as an individual painting. The ten separate paintings that compose this screen are grouped in four pairs, with an individual composition mounted on the first and last panels of the screen. Each of the four pairs in the middle can be read as a single composition or as two separate paintings. Such visual double entendres held a special allure for Korean literati artists of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. This screen's large size and its royal authorship indicate that it was painted for one of the royal palaces.

Each painting bears a personal seal of the artist, rather than a seal with the artist's name or sobriquet. For example, the seal in the lower right corner of the ninth panel (second from the left) translates into the aphorism ""The best time to view a flower is when it is half open."" The other nine personal seal impressions vary from idiomatic phrases to humorous remarks on Daoism and Buddhism. In the very last panel at the far left, however, Yi Ha-ŭng signs and impresses two of his artist's seals to the painting, making the authorship of this important screen indisputable. His inscription translates as, ""Done by the seventy-three-year-old old man Sŏk-p'a in the early autumn of 1892.""

(A magnificent screen by Prince Yi Ha-ŭng is featured in this gallery's glass-fronted screen case.) A professor of painting and calligraphy at the Institute of Arts in Seoul, Kim was also one of the founders of the Painting and Calligraphy Association, established in 1918. 

The orchid, a symbol of loyalty and personal integrity, held a fascination for literati painters, since its grasslike leaves and delicate, simple flowers lent themselves to depiction with calligraphic brushwork. Chinese artists had begun to paint the orchid during the Song dynasty (960-1279), the subject becoming ever more popular in the succeeding Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. By the eighteenth century, the taste for paintings of orchids had spread to Korea, where these works enjoyed considerable vogue in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 

Chinese and Korean artists typically paired orchids and rocks, the orchids coaxing the artist to employ his most delicate, curvilinear brushwork, the rocks tempting him to present his most forceful and expressionistic brushwork. The inscription on this painting translates as:

While sitting quietly, I sense a subtle fragrance.
Such subtlety exists only between reality and imagination.

The son of a portrait painter, Ren Yi learned to paint at a young age and in adulthood used his art as his livelihood. After living for a time in Ningbo and Suzhou, Ren finally settled in the newly developed port city of Shanghai in 1868. From his base in bustling Shanghai, Ren Yi developed a new and novel style of painting that won him a wide audience and made him the acknowledged leader of the Shanghai school, or Haipai. Though it favors light colors, Ren's style is at once bold, forceful, and vivid, as exemplified by this delightful bird-and-flower painting.

Depicting a small bird with outstretched wings darting through the attenuated stems of lotus growing in a pond, this painting adopts a perspective that brings the viewer down to the water's surface, virtually eye-to-eye with the tiny creature. The broad, blue-green lotus leaves and lush white blossoms appear enormous as they loom above the bird, while a thick forest of lotus stems nearly camouflages it altogether. Faint brush strokes representing water reeds and grasses delineate the pond's surface, which would otherwise appear as a void.

The lotus is an important motif in Chinese art that traces its symbolic origins to Buddhism. Because it grows in muddy waters, yet emerges upright, unsullied, fragrant, and beautiful, the lotus became an emblem of purity in Buddhist literature and imagery. The two Chinese terms for lotus--lian and he--are phonetically identical to numerous auspicious phrases, such as love and harmony, and are thus ubiquitous in Chinese folk art and rebuses.

In some cases, a Korean screen may feature a single, unified composition that spreads across all its panels; in other instances--such as this one--each panel is conceived as an individual painting.

Representing bamboo through the four seasons, this eight-panel screen is meant to be ""read"" by the viewer from right to left. The first two paintings, at the far right, depict newly sprung shoots and fresh stalks of bamboo emerging from the ground in spring. The next pair of images display lush, hearty stalks of bamboo enduring the strong winds and warm sun of summer. The relative sparseness, dry ink tones, and overlapping mist visible in the next two paintings convey characteristics of the autumn months. The last pair of images, at the far left, which depict old, thick, broken stalks of bamboo with hints of new stalks in one painting and bamboo branches heavily laden with snow in the other, complete the cycle with the winter season. Though the paintings lack inscriptions and signatures, two red, square seal impressions at the upper left corner of the far--left panel identify two sobriquets of the artist Yu Tŏk-chang (1675-1765) and thus reveal the creator of this masterful work of art.

A follower of the famous Korean bamboo-painting master Yi Chŏng (1541-1622), Yu Tŏk-chang was one of the most prominent literati artists of the Chosŏn dynasty (1392-1910). Like their Koryŏ-dynasty (918-1392) predecessors, both Yi and Yu took inspiration from the work of Chinese literati painters of the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1279-1368) dynasties. Their paintings thus tend to resemble literati paintings by early Chinese masters, rather than works produced by their Chinese contemporaries. In this screen, however, Yu departs from the Chinese model and exhibits the distinctly Korean style of bamboo painting he learned from Yi Chŏng: the two tones of ink used to starkly distinguish fore-and background subjects; the angular mists that abruptly interrupt a scene; and the thick stumps of bamboo with sharp, broken edges. 

Bamboo painting was extremely popular among the literati, perhaps because of its association with the so-called Four Gentlemen--plum blossoms, orchids, chrysanthemums, and bamboo. All four of these botanical subjects, which readily lend themselves to depiction with calligraphic brushwork, are said to embody the virtues to which Confucian scholars aspired, such as integrity, purity, and strength in the face of adversity. So important was the ability to paint bamboo that in the fifteenth century it outranked even landscape painting in the official examinations for Korea's royal painting academy.

He is said as a boy to have been deeply impressed by the work of a renowned fourteenth-century plum blossom painter, Wang Mian (1287-1359) and to have vowed to devote his life to mastering the subject painted by this master.  Not content with merely copying, Liu wandered the hills of his district studying plum trees to enrich his understanding of the subject.  In addition to his few extant paintings, his illustrated manual on ink-plum painting, Xuehu meipu, survives to represent his art.  Because it blooms in February, before donning its leaves, the Chinese plum (prunus mume) is associated with winter and is regarded as a symbol of strength in the face of adversity.  In addition, its blossoms symbolize feminine beauty and its weathered trunk the humble scholar.  

The artist's poem on this painting, inscribed in the upper left, reads:
A green dragon, it rears up high and seems to reach for the Milky Way
Like jade butterflies, in irregular patterns, unsoiled by mud.
Suddenly the Wind God Fengyi gives forth a wild whistle
And the splendor of spring is scattered all over, east and west.

According to the tenth book of the Bhagavata Purana, the young Krishna and his elder half-brother, Balarama, are separated from the rest of the cowherd and their cows, who enter deep into the forest in search of fresh grass. Suddenly, they are encircled by a large and violent fire, with no means to escape. They call out to Krishna for help, and the deity rushes over and swallows up all of the flames, saving them. While many depictions of the scene portray Krishna, the cowherds, and the animals within a fiery landscape, the artist here has chosen to depict Krishna alone to dramatize the moment when he manifests his divine power.

framed: 66.04 x 58.42 x 1.91 cm (26 x 23 x 3/4 in.)",Department of Islamic & Later Indian Art,"The painting depicts Maharao Durjan Sal of Kota (r. 1723-1756) plaiting Krishna’s hair. The Maharao is distinguished by his double-pearl earring, elaborate dress and jewelry, and halo bordering his profile. Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu, revered as a god in his own right. The enthroned blue-skinned deity also bears double-pearl earring, jewelry, and halo. Krishna gesters to a priest seated cross-legged in front of him, who wears a translucent shawl and white skirt. Three other figures face Krishna, either seated or standing. An attendant near the throne carries a long sword over his left shoulder. Behind Durjan Sal is an attendant carrying a fan made of peacock feathers. 
The depiction of Krishna refers to Brijnathji, a local form of Krishna that was the family deity of the royal family of Kota. Brijnathji is frequently rendered either accompanying a ruler or participating in Kota courtly activities, conflates the deity with the ruler, fostering the concept of the “divine king”, and demonstrates a direct relationship between the king and god.

The imagery of a baby reclining on a banyan tree (vatavriksha) or leaf (vatapatra) is found in the texts of the Mahabharata, the Matsya Purana, and the Bhagavata Purana. In the context of the pictorial depictions of the theme in the Bhagavata Purana, the child is usually depicted lying on a banyan leaf.

According to the twelfth book of the Bhagavata Purana, the sage Markandeya gained immortality and swam across the cosmic ocean indefinitely. As he swam in the cosmic ocean, he came across the infant Krishna, who opened his mouth to reveal the creation of the universe. Krishna’s infancy represents the formation of a new world cycle. The rich blue hue of Krishna’s skin and heavy, dreamy eyes are characteristic of paintings from Nathdwara. The ‘Vatapatrasayi Krishna’ or ‘Bala-Mukunda’ became an important theme starting in the 18th century in the paintings of Nathdwara in Rajasthan, a great center of Vallabha Sampradaya, a religious sect devoted to the worship of Krishna.

The gold idol represents, Navantipriyaji (“The one who loves fresh butter”), another form of Krishna that is said to be a child-like form. The base of the stairs is fenced in and contains a large group of worshippers. The front register of the painting contains a large herd of cows with red handprints on their bodies.

frame: H. 48.6 x W. 48.6 cm (19 1/8 x 19 1/8 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"This album leaf was painted by Pu Ru (1896-1963), a member of the Qing imperial family and a cousin of the last emperor. Known for his exceptionally elegant paintings in classical style, Pu Ru was one of the most famous and most talented poets, painters, and calligraphers of the first half of the twentieth century. Painted in ink and colors on paper, this large, square album leaf represents a landscape with two mountain pavilions. A narrow body of water--likely a lake or river-- stretches across the bottom of the composition, its edge bordered by several rocky outcroppings that recede diagonally into the composition. Appearing just to the right of the composition's center, several majestic pines grow from these rocks. Seen through the pines and partially obscured by them, two mountain pavilions rise in the middleground, probably from hills just beyond the foreground rocks. Four deciduous trees in full leaf grow from rocks at the left of the composition. A tall, round-topped mountain dominates the right side of the composition, and a triangular mountain towers in the background, its details obscured by mist. The artist's inscription and signature appear at the top center of the painting in eight columns of calligraphy that read from right to left; one seal of the artist appears at the beginning of the inscription and another just to the left of the signature (i.e., the last column of calligraphy). Except for the reddish browns used for the mountain pavilions, the artist has restricted the painting's palette to cool blues and greens.

Pu Ru (1896-1963), courtesy name Xinyu, was a native of Beijing and a member of the Manchu imperial family. He was cousin of the last Emperor Henry Pu Yi and was one of the children of the imperial family who was presented at the palace as a candidate to be considered as a possible future emperor. After the overthrow of the Qing dynasty, Pu Ru generally used his hao, or sobriquet, Pu Xinyu. He studied at Berlin University, majoring in astronomy and biology. After returning from Europe, he retreated into the Western Mountains (of Beijing), where he spent many years at the Jietai Monastery to develop his painting skills. He was strongly against Pu Yi's (his cousin's) cooperation with Japan. Pu Xinyu's retreat to the Western Mountains explains the sobriquet that he used in the signature on this painting:  ""Xishan Yishi Pu Ru"" which means ""Hermit of the Western Mountains, Pu Ru."" 

Pu Ru was a well-known teacher of poetry, painting, and calligraphy, first on the Chinese mainland and then on Taiwan, where he retreated in 1949, along with the Nationalist government. He received students, but the teacher-student relationship was very much in the classical sense, almost a parent-child relationship, in which the teacher, like the father, carried the responsibility of the well-being, character-building and spiritual development of the child. Therefore before he accepted a student, Pu Ru carefully examined the student's character and family background.

His training was highly disciplinary. He demanded that his students prepare their own ink using traditional inksticks and inkstones, for such preparation brought peace and equanimity to the mind, qualities that would assist the painter in connecting himself to the spirit of art and creativity or to the sphere of beauty and grace. In the entire first year of training with Pu Xinyu, the student was not allowed to paint, but to practice calligraphy only. In the entire second year, he was to draw rocks, mountains and branches of trees. In the third year, he was allowed to cover the trees and branches with leaves, and so on. This kind of schooling builds up the total command of the brush as well as humility and strength. Every Saturday morning, his students would gather around him to receive a lesson in Chinese literature, after which their works were presented to the master and new assignments were given. In these Saturday mornings classes, Master Pu never just talked; he was always doing something else at the same time, either calligraphy, painting, or playing a moon-sitar (a string instrument), many times with his precious white face long-armed monkey clinging to his chest. He was often amused by what he was painting and liked to make fun of the figures which he created.

mounting silk only: H. 160 x W. 84.5 cm (63 x 33 1/4 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"Dong Shouping (1904-1997) painted this short hanging scroll in ink and colors on paper. It depicts Mt. Emei's famous and very colorful sunrise. A mass of rocks--presumably the mountain's summit--occupies the left half, and more, of the painting, its diagonally set ridges alternating with valleys. The waterfall that emerges from a valley in the painting's lower left corner disappears into the mist at the bottom of the painting. Pines cluster around the lone, simple house that is perched at the right edge of the mountain mass. Their details obscured by mist, distant peaks occupy the right portion of the composition. The uppermost portion of the painting is blank, suggesting the sky. Because Mt. Emei is famous for its colorful sunrise, the artist has employed a warm orange as the painting's dominant color. The painting was mounted in Japan and thus boasts a traditional Japanese mounting with free-moving futai ornaments. This painting is not dated by inscription; we have dated it to c. 1961 on the basis of its stylistic similarity to the other Lin-bequest painting by Dong Shouping--which also represents Mt. Emei and also shows warm orange tones--which is dated by inscription to 1961. 

The artist, Dong Shouping (1904-1997), was born in Hongdong, Shanxi province, in 1904. He received a BA in economics from Eastern University, Beijing, in 1926, after which he began to paint by studying masterworks of traditional painting on the then newly established National Palace Museum, Beijing. By 1931 he had become well-known as a connoisseur of Chinese painting and as a professional painter of birds and flowers; at that time he began to hone his skills as a landscape painter. During the Sino-Japanese War (1937-45, i.e., World War II), Dong Shouping lived in Chengdu, Sichuan province; in order to broaden his skill as a landscape painter, he traveled as widely as circumstances permitted, taking in as many varied landscape types as he could. It was during these years that he came to know and love Mt. Emei. After both the Sino-Japanese and Chinese Civil wars had ended, Dong Shouping took up residence in Beijing. In 1953 he joined Rongbaozhai Art Publishing House, Beijing, as a specialist in woodblock printing; he worked there until 1965, where he retired. He served as honorary chairman of the Beijing Society for the Research of Traditional Chinese Paintings, and he was a member of the Chinese Artists' Association.

Mt Emei sits at the western rim of the Sichuan Basin; at 3,099 meters (10,167 ft), it is the highest of China's Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains. The ""patron saint"" of Mt. Emei is the Buddhist Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, known in Chinese as Puxian Pu. Mt. Emei was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Mt. Emei enjoys a special reverence in the minds of traditional Chinese as it is the location of the first Buddhist temple built in China in the first century CE. The site boasts seventy-six Buddhist monasteries dating to the Ming and Qing periods, most of them located near the mountain's top. 
Mt. Emei is famous for its colorful spectacles, which include the sunrise and the Clouds Sea both of which are best seen from the mountain's Golden Summit and both of which have been considered famous natural wonders for centuries. The sunrise is varied, but optimally begins with the ground and sky being in the same dark purple, soon showing rosy clouds, followed by a bright purple arc and then a semicircle where the sun is coming up. The Clouds Sea includes several cloud phenomena, e.g. clouds appearing in the sky above, in addition to the regular clouds beneath.

The tall mountain that rises along the painting's central, vertical axis dominates the composition. A deep valley flanks the central mountain on either side; the valleys separate the central peak from the subsidiary mountains that appear at left and right, and they afford views of the mist-obscured mountains and waterfalls that occupy the distant background. The landscape, which was painted in ink on paper, appears solely in tones of black and gray. Painted in the early 1970s, when the artist was experimenting with various and varied techniques of applying ink to paper, the painting reveals that the artist crumpled localized areas of the paper before he applied the ink; the crumpling created a network of lines in the paper that absorbed the ink more readily than the surrounding matrix, so that those lines appear very black in the finished painting. They are most visible in the center of the dominant mountain. In utilizing this crumpling technique, the artist relied upon the resulting network of lines, rather than upon traditional brushwork, to texture the craggy mountain surfaces. Once the paper had been properly and appropriately crumpled, the artist used ink washes to create the mountains; the then used even wetter washes of ink to create the very cloudy skies. Of course, the artist used a brush to manipulate the ink washes, just as he also used a brush to add the large dots in the foreground that suggest trees and other foliage.

Wang Jiqian--originally named Wang Jiquan--was born into a distinguished, scholarly family in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, in 1907. He received a classical Chinese education at home, studying with a private tutor. He began to study painting when he was fourteen years old. Although he studied law at Suzhou University (in Shanghai), his real love was Chinese painting, which he studied with several masters, first with Gu Linshi (1865-1933) and then with famed master Wu Hufan (1894-1968) with whom he became close friends. Through Wu, Wang Jiqian gained access to the excellent private collection of Pang Yuanqi (1865-1949). Through study and through first-hand examination of Chinese paintings, Wang became not only a leading painter but a leading connoisseur of classical Chinese paintings. In fact, in 1935 and 1936, he served as an adviser to the Chinese government on the organization of the large exhibition of Chinese art that was featured at Burlington House, London, in 1936.

Wang Jiqian moved to the U.S. in 1949. He served as a Visiting Lecturer on Chinese painting at Columbia University and he studied Western painting techniques at the Art Students League, New York. Wang Jiqian and Zhang Daqian (1899-1983) quickly became the two most famous Chinese ink painters living and working in the U.S. In the end, Wang is remembered as a respected artist, scholar, collector, and connoisseur  and is known for his distinctive landscape paintings in which ink was often applied without a brush (like the Lin-bequest painting that we are considering here).

Emei's famous and very colorful sunrise. Diagonally set masses of rocks lead to the peak--presumably the Mt. Emei's summit--at the top center of the composition. Tall pines at the bottom center of the composition direct the viewer's eye to the summit and to the lone, simple house with orange walls and pale gray roof that sits atop the peak. The mountain slopes downward at the right, leaving open sky as well as space for the artist's inscription, signature, and seal. Because Mt. Emei is famous for its colorful sunrise, the artist has employed a warm orange as the painting's dominant color. The painting was mounted in Japan and thus boasts a traditional Japanese mounting with free-moving futai ornaments.

","max.: H. 17.8 x W. 52.2 cm (7 x 20 9/16 in.)
mounting: H. 32.1 x W. 62.2 cm (12 5/8 x 24 1/2 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"Once affixed to a folding-fan frame, this painting is now mounted flat as an album leaf. The painting, which Lü Yao did in ink and light colors on gold-flecked paper, represents two herdboys and an ox in a limited landscape. The ox appears in the lower right corner of the composition standing in a stream near the thicket of bamboo that borders the painting's right edge. One boy sits astride the ox's back while the other, who stands in the center of the composition, pulls on a rope attached to the ox's nose, trying valiantly to induce the stubborn ox to step out of the stream and onto dry land. The two old, gnarled willow trees that grow on the far bank of the river dominate the left half of the composition and frame a dwelling that must lie beyond the picket fence. The artist's inscription, signature, and seals appear in the upper right portion of the painting.

The theme of herdboys and oxen first became popular in China during the Southern Song period (1127-1279). When it first appeared, it had Zen overtones. While not a major theme of Chinese painting, the subject continued to enjoy some limited popularity in the succeeding Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. The Harvard Art Museum collection includes one painting on this theme (1923.146), an album leaf from the Ming dynasty representing one boy on the back of a water buffalo, and one small Ming-dynasty jade (1942.185.122), a paperweight in gray nephrite representing one boy on the back of a recumbent water buffalo.

We have not yet found the artist, Lü Yao, mentioned in any literature on the history of Chinese painting. Although we at first thought the painting might date to the eighteenth century, we now believe that it likely was done in Shanghai in the nineteenth century by an artist of the so-called Shanghai school. In the nineteenth century, the bingchen cyclical year corresponds to 1856.

In the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries, the bingchen cyclical year corresponds to 1736, 1796, 1856, and 1916. The painting has to have been done in one of those years.

Wang Jiqian’s landscapes have been termed “mountains of the mind” for their inventiveness and power. The modern look of his paintings results in part from his practice of applying ink with auxiliary papers or implements other than brushes.
Yet his work also has classical references, seen here in the composition, which contrasts verticals on one side with horizontals on the other, a device used at least as early as the eighth century in Chinese landscape painting.
Wang Jiqian was known throughout his career as a connoisseur and collector of classical Chinese paintings. Wang studied traditional landscape painting in Shangahi under Wu Hufan (1894–1968), but in the late 1940s he moved to New York, where he pursued Western drawing techniques.

The first part of the inscription, however, expresses the dilemma of combining tradition with experimentation: “Some think bringing forth new ideas is good; others think relying on the past is good. I sing a new melody, but use the old tone. Am I neither here nor there?”
Trained in Beijing by artists of the former Manchu court, Zeng mastered the classical tradition in both technique and spirit.

After leaving China to settle in Honolulu, Zeng Youhe developed a distinctive technique she called dsui (pinyin zhui, meaning “patch” or “patchwork”) painting, inspired in part by traditional techniques for mounting Chinese works.
Like other artists in Asia as well as Europe and America, she used this collage approach to explore surface effects in abstract compositions.

To produce these effects, Liu Guosong paints on an artisanal paper in which long, coarse fibers are preserved near the paper’s surface. After applying ink to the paper with a brush and by other means, he pulls out selected filaments to achieve a pictorial effect that is simultaneously representational and abstract.
Liu Guosong, founder of the Fifth Moon Group, came to prominence in Taipei in the 1950s and remained at the forefront of the movement. He had left mainland China for Taiwan in 1949. In recent years, Liu has exhibited on the mainland, and in 2007 his work was featured in the first solo exhibition ever given a living artist at the Palace Museum in Beijing. This painting was included in that landmark exhibition.",Paintings,2013.0,Gift

Liu, who founded the Fifth Moon Group in 1956, played an important role as a teacher in the arts. From his earliest teaching appointment in Taiwan in 1960, through his visiting appointments at universities in the U.S. and his senior teaching and administrative appointments in Hong Kong and Taiwan, he has shaped the development of painting and energized the interplay of Chinese and Western elements.",Paintings,2014.0,Gift

Feng Zhongrui, who left China for Taiwan in 1949, was a member of the Fifth Moon Group.

Feng Zhongrui joined the Fifth Moon Group—an association of Taiwan artists concerned with the modernization of Chinese art—in 1961.

Feng Zhongrui, who had moved from China to Taiwan in 1949, was active in the modernist movement led by members of the Fifth Moon Group.

Hong Xian used traditional Chinese brushwork in a composition that recalls Western format and picture space. Though not without precedent in Chinese art, the large horizontal format and the vantage point offering a panoramic view most likely have their sources in Western painting.
Hong Xian left China for Taiwan in 1948, and there had the remarkable opportunity to study traditional Chinese painting with Pu Ru (1896–1963), the former Manchu prince, whose work preserved the noble court painting traditions of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). She also studied art at National Taiwan Normal University. In 1958 she came to the U.S., where she studied Western art at Northwestern University and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

“Home” for Yu was mainland China. He served as a general in the Chinese army during the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45) and then moved to Taiwan with the Nationalist government in 1949. With no formal training in the arts, he took up painting in 1954.

The artist did not sign this painting, but impressed his seal near the lower right corner.
The inscription on the painting is not by the artist, but by Rao Zongyi, a scholar. The inscription reads, “Emerald layers cover old trailing branches. The sky, with stars densely packed, is revealed. Chu-tsing asked Ximing to paint this.”
The artist, who received his training at the Shanghai Academy of Art, spent the war years in Sichuan province and later moved to Hong Kong, where he taught painting in an academic setting.

The otherworldly beauty of the scene recalls the Daoist lands of the immortals depicted by Wu Bin (active 1591–1643), in which fantasy and reality coalesce in a strange yet alluringly harmonic world. The close-up view of the mountains in this painting reveals the dry brushwork and “scorched ink” that have become Xia Yifu’s characteristic techniques.
Despite the artist’s limited formal academic training in painting and calligraphy, his works display an air of elegance that reflects a classic aesthetic vision.

Practitioners of the technique often claim that it offers a more direct means of self-expression. The Chinese
tradition of applying ink to paper with the fingers or fingernails instead of a brush is said to date back as far as the Tang dynasty (618–907), demonstrating that innovative techniques in Chinese painting are not strictly modern.

The thin gray ink washes that make up the sky and distant mountains impart a sense of gloom and yet are tempered by the bright yellow sun hovering above. The use of splashed ink in painting has a long tradition in China; many artists, both ancient and modern, have created a personal style through its unpredictability and spontaneity.
Li Huasheng’s career has been dogged by politics: during the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) he was forced to paint in secret, and then, during the Spiritual Pollution campaign in 1983, when the government criticized artists for their “decadence and impurity,” he was targeted as an enemy of the state.",Paintings,2013.0,Gift

Wan Qingli’s work reflects his diverse background and training. Growing up in Beijing, he learned classical poetry and painting from Li Keran (1907–1989) and from Lu Yanshao (1909–1993). Yet his self-expressive means reveal a propensity for synthesizing old and new. This landscape is markedly different from classical snowscapes. A feeling of starkness and modernity pervades the otherwise timeless mountain scene. Reflections in the icy water create an impression of moonlight, and the low vantage point suggests the artist’s experimentation with picture space.

But [they] had never seen these hills, so they did not establish this method. . . .” The implication is that a new landscape in a new world validates a new approach. Though Wan may have felt a cultural loneliness in America, he no doubt found the natural beauty of this continent of great inspiration.
In 1989 Wan left America to teach in Hong Kong. Though Hong Kong’s culture is more familiar, urban life troubles him. He turns to nature for solace, as suggested by the second half of his inscription: “People today only follow the decadent school of ink painting and are, therefore, unaware of the true meaning of ink and brush.

Yu Peng’s childhood interests in puppetry and ink and oil painting led him to develop a style so eccentric that he was denied admission into any fine arts school. His search for his cultural roots took him from his native Taiwan to mainland China, where he visited Beijing, Hangzhou, and the Buddhist caves at Dunhuang, in Gansu province. He found elements of folk art that he incorporated into his paintings.
Exaggeration, spatial fragmentation, and deliberate clumsiness yield a comic theatricality.

mounting (including cord and roller ends): H. 206 x W. 65.5 cm (81 1/8 x 25 13/16 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"Executed in ink and light color on paper, this painting in hanging scroll format depicts a white heron standing in shallow waters before grasses, reeds, and a blossoming lotus plant. The heron is portrayed in profile facing the viewer's left, with one leg straight and submerged beneath the water, the other bent and raised slightly above the surface, revealing its talons. The lotus plant artfully frames the bird -- a broad, dark colored lotus leaf provides a contrasting backdrop to the bird’s white, feathered body, while another curled leaf and full white blossom hover above its head like a canopy. While the heron is painted in reserve -- the white of the paper left unpainted while a series of short ink brushstrokes outline his main form -- select areas of foliage are saturated in wet colors, the diluted pigments pooled and layered to create a blurred, watery effect in the composition. The artist, An Chung-sik, inscribed, dated, signed, and applied his seals at the upper left, indicating that he painted the work in the eighth lunar month of the year corresponding to 1909.  

In both the Chinese and Korean traditions, the heron and lotus depicted together is a symbol of the ideal Confucian scholar, as the terms for both form a rebus representing the continual success of a scholar-official.

frame: 144.5 x 93 cm (56 7/8 x 36 5/8 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"Painted in ink, mineral colors, and gold leaf on coarsely woven silk, this painting represents an elderly Buddhist monk seated cross-legged on a bamboo mat decorated with geometric designs. An inscription brush-written in gold pigment indicates that the monk belongs to the Sŏn sect (Chinese, Chan; Japanese, Zen); the inscription further identifies the monk as Master Teacher Kim P'a-tang. The monk holds a staff in his proper left hand and a Buddhist rosary in his right hand. The monk's head and face are shaven. The monk wears a charcoal gray robe over pale gray underrobes. A red patchwork apron tied with white and green cords covers the monk's abdomen; the apron extends around the monk's proper right side to cover his back as well; the edge of the apron's back appears below the monk's proper left elbow. The wood graining is carefully detailed in both staff and rosary; in addition, gold foil highlights embellish the top and bottom of the staff, suggesting the metal ends of the monk's actual staff. The green background is intricately decorated with the bajixiang (Chinese, ""Eight Auspicious Emblems"") set amidst scrolling clouds. The red apron is embellished with characters in gold leaf, each character set on a small square green ground, as follows: Korean, ch'ŏn; Chinese, tian; near the monk's proper left shoulder, Korean, wang; Chinese, wang; at lower right front corner of red apron, Sanskrit ""seed"" character; at lower right back corner of red apron.

Although bamboo mats had appeared in portraits, both religious and secular, by the mid-Chosŏn period, decorated bamboo mats seem not to have appeared until the eighteenth century. They become a typical feature of secular portraits in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century. As a religious work, however, this painting would seem to date to the early or mid-eighteenth century.

The silk is coarsely woven; fortunately, the original backing paper is present, so the pigments in the interstices of the silk have not been lost in remounting. The gold leaf used for the Chinese characters on the apron is lifting in localized areas; in fact, it has flaked away in a few areas, and it has completely disappeared from the character wang, which can be read from the ""ghost imprint"" left by the adhesive that once held the gold leaf in place.

In their earliest representations (i.e., those of the ninth century, mostly in scrolls and wall paintings from Dunhuang), the Ten Kings of Hell are shown together with Chijang Posal; by the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Chijang Posal tended to be represented separately from the Ten Kings who increasingly were shown in sets of ten paintings (with one King per painting), whether in China, Korea, or Japan. By the eighteenth century, however, Korean Buddhist paintings typically again portray the Ten Kings together with Chijang Posal, as seen in this painting.

In this painting, Chijang Posal is seated at the center of the composition. Six of the Ten Kings appear at the bottom of the composition, standing in a row in front of Chijang Posal; the remaining four Kings appear in the middle row of figures, two standing on each side of Chijang Posal. Monk Tomyŏng and the three officials comprise the top row of figures, two standing on each side of Chijang Posal. Monk Tomyŏng is the youthful figure with shaven pate and monk's robes immediately to Chijang Posal's proper right. Following the hierarchical tenets of Buddhist iconography, Chijang Posal is shown larger than the other figures. Unlike other bodhisattvas, who are depicted in the trappings of an early Indian prince--with long hair, brocaded dhoti and scarves, and elaborate jewelry including earrings, bracelets, armlets, and anklets--Chijang Posal is traditionally presented in the guise of a Buddhist monk and thus wears monk's robes and has a shaven pate. In this portrayal he also has a ribbon(?) attached to each side of his head, one behind each ear. The Kings of Hell wear simple, Chinese-style crowns and the robes of Chinese officials (with the belts conventionally associated with those robes); several of the kings also hold scepters that symbolize their rank. The official at the far left end (viewer's left) of the top row of figures wears a military commander's hat and holds a placard on a pole, while the official at the far right end wears a civil official's hat and holds a scroll, the scroll symbolizing the list of good and bad deeds of the deceased that Chijang Posal and the Ten Kings of Hell will review in deciding the status that the deceased will experience in his/her next rebirth.

Cursorily done, this work is not a finished painting but a sketch, preliminary drawing, or underdrawing for a finished painting. Because it is not (and was not intended to be) a finished work, there are many small changes in the composition, with several sets of brushstrokes indicating a change in a figure's facial features, in the position of another figure's hands, etc. In addition, the palette is extremely limited, whereas finished Buddhist paintings tend to be highly colorful.

336967,Six Landscapes,Korean,"Chosŏn dynasty, 1392-1910",19th century,"Six-panel folding screen; ink and light colors on silk; with signature reading ""Hyo-san""; with seals reading ""Hyo San"" and ""Kim Chae Tŏk In"" at the end of the inscription on the last panel","each panel painting proper: 90.3 x 32.6 cm (35 9/16 x 12 13/16 in.)
frame overall: 170 x 257 cm (66 15/16 x 101 3/16 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"This six-panel folding screen presents six individual landscape scenes. The landscapes reflect the so-called Orthodox style that became popular in China in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries among such followers of Dong Qichang (1555-1636) as the so-called Four Wang--i.e., Wang Shimin (1592-1680), Wang Jian (1598-1677), Wang Hui (1632-1717), and Wang Yuanqi (1642-1715); the Orthodox style came to prominence in Korea in the nineteenth century, particularly in the works of Hŏ Ryŏn (1809-1892) and his followers. Each of this screen's landscapes presents a large mountain massed either in the center or at one side of the composition; each landscape affords a view into the far distance, just as each has a body of water--a lake or a wide river--at the bottom of the composition. Most of the landscapes include mountain pavilions, and the last one--i.e., the landscape at the viewer's left--includes a village nestled at the base of the distant mountains. The landscapes are done mainly in ink though a few sport touches of light color. The last landscape is a winter scene, so that the snow-covered mountains are rendered very schematically, and the cloudy skies are darker than the pristine mountains.

The inscription, signature, and seals indicate that these paintings were done by Kim Chae-tŏk during the ninth lunar month of 1869. Though little documentation survives concerning his life, Kim Chae-tŏk is known to have lived in the nineteenth century. He is believed to have been a professional painter and likely was active in Kyŏngsang province, probably in Taegu or Andong. (In fact, Estate records suggest that Jerry Lee Musslewhite purchased this screen in Taegu, North Kyŏngsang province.) The style of these paintings is related to that of Kim Yong (born 1837), a well-known, nineteenth-century, Korean painter.

Differing from Japanese traditional practice, in which two screens are paired to form a set, Korean screens generally are conceived as individual, stand-alone works rather than as pairs. And, unlike Japanese screens, which generally have six panels, Korean screens may have six, eight, ten, or even twelve panels. Whereas most Japanese pairs of screens boast a single, unified composition that spreads the full width of both screens, Korean screens may have a single, unified composition or they may have a series of individual compositions, one on each panel. This screen has just six panels, with one discrete painting on each panel.

Jerry Lee Musslewhite, or the Korean dealer from whom he purchased it, had this screen remounted in Korea in the 1960s, so the mounting is new and clean and shows virtually no wear. Given that six is an unusual number of panels for a landscape screen and that the last scene is a winter scene, it is possible that the original screen might have had eight panels and that the screen's theme was landscapes of the four seasons, with two panels for each season. Since there are only six panels today and since the artist did not inscribe a title, we likely will never know the original number of panels or the exact subject (other than generic landscapes).

Here it might be noted that the Estate of Jerry Lee Musslewhite included four additional landscapes by Kim Chae-tŏk, each framed and presented as a discrete painting. The paintings are very similar in subject matter, style, and composition to those in this screen; even the seals are virtually identical. It is unknown whether or not there is any connection between those four individual paintings and this screen.

The text is written in a combination of Chinese characters, or ""kanji"", and native Japanese script, or ""hiragana"". Inscribed by Takabatake Shikibu (1785-1881), the poem is written in script that alternates between cursive, or running, script (Chinese, ""xingshu"") and draft script (Chinese, ""caoshu""). Though not dated, this calligraphic work bears a signature of the artist in the lower right corner--i.e., the second column of text from the right is the artist's signature. The poem is inscribed on an album leaf of a type known in Japanese as a ""shikishi"", or poem card. At some point the ""shikishi"" album leaf was mounted as a hanging scroll, the form in which it appears today. In the present mounting, the album leaf appears just below the center of a long stretch of buff mounting paper, which is bordered top and bottom by a strip of white mounting silk with brocaded designs woven in gold; above and below the gold-on-white strips and along the sides of the buff paper is dark green mounting silk subtly embellished with a woven pattern; at the top and bottom of the scroll appear longer sections of plain, medium brown mounting silk, the slightly longer top section articulated with affixed (i.e., mounted in place) ""futai"" streamers.",Paintings,2010.0,Gift

The several very slender stalks of bamboo rise from a small, grass-covered hillock in the lower right corner. The composition is organized around the one very tall and several short stalks of bamboo that are depicted in black ink and that are thus to be read as nearest the viewer; the tallest of those stalks rises through the composition on a slight diagonal and reaches almost to the upper left corner. Several additional stalks of bamboo, some tall, some short, are depicted in gray ink, indicating both that they are slightly farther away from the viewer and that they are partially obscured by heavy mist. All of the bamboo stalks, whether painted in vibrant black or pale gray ink, appear in the foreground plane; the composition does not recede into deep three-dimensional space, so no middle- or background elements are included. The leaves and stalks are well painted; in addition, the varying heights of the bamboo stalks and the varying tonalities of ink lend visual and aesthetic balance to the composition. The artist's two-column inscription and signature appear in the lower left portion of the painting; planned as an integral element of the composition, they fill an area that otherwise would have been blank, resulting in an unbalanced composition. The painting is not dated, but it is one of the artist's mature works and it reflects the influence of the Japanese Nanga style, indicating that it was painted at the end of the nineteenth or, more likely, during the first one-third of the twentieth century.",Paintings,2010.0,Gift

mounting, including cord and roller ends: H. 288 x W. 90.6 cm (113 3/8 x 35 11/16 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"This triptych comprises a set of three hanging scrolls, each painted in ink on paper. The central scroll is a formal portrait of Mao Zedong (1893–1976); the flanking scrolls represent landscapes. The Mao portrait is based both on the official portrait photograph of Mao Zedong that was taken in 1959 by Xinhua News Agency photojournalists Meng Qingbiao (1925–1969) and Ho Bo (born 1924) and on the official portrait painting of Chairman Mao that that was created in 1959 by Zhang Zhenshi (1914–1992), a professor at the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, Beijing, based on the official portrait photograph. The portrait presents a bust-length, frontal portrait of Chairman Mao, his head and shoulders turned slightly, almost imperceptibly, to his proper right. His hair is combed straight back, his eyes are fully open, and his mouth suggests a slight smile. He wears a Mao jacket, buttoned all the way to the top; one circular button appears in the inverted “V” formed by the two downward-projecting points of the collar. Perhaps part of the Mao-jacket collar, perhaps the top of a collar of a shirt worn under the jacket, a slender white line encircles Chairman Mao’s neck, readily distinguishing garment from flesh. A circular black disc appears in the center of the otherwise unembellished white paper above Chairman Mao’s head. The background area of the portrait—but not the area above the portrait—are fully textured, so that the image of Chairman Mao emerges from a gray background. The characters that appear throughout the painting, both in the portrait of Chairman Mao and in the disc above—i.e., one character within each square of the grid—read Mao Ze Dong; arranged in random order, they also appear in random orientations, some right side up, others upside down, and yet others sideways. The “texturing characters” appear in the image of Mao, in the background areas, and in the disc above but are most evident in the background areas and in the disc. A long inscription comprising 180 characters appears in the rectangular border surrounding the painting. A narrow strip of unembellished white paper appears just inside the border, clearly differentiating border from portrait.

Each landscape scroll presents a view into a deep mountain valley that recedes distantly into the pictorial space. Each landscape is a bilaterally symmetrical rendition of the other, so that the landscapes are mirror images of each other. Appearing black and positioned at the “inside edge” of each landscape composition—i.e., on the side of the composition opposite from the blank grid square that is an “implied seal” (see description below)—a towering foreground peak partially blocks the view of the mountain range that rises on one side of the valley. Silhouetted against the receding valley, old pines grow around the periphery of the foreground peak and around the top of the shorter peak that accompanies it. When the landscape scrolls are hung on either side of the central scroll, the dark, foreground peaks frame the Mao portrait. A rectangular area of blank paper appears above each landscape, and a dark border frames each composition and the accompanying blank paper above, a narrow strip of unembellished white paper separating border from landscape, the arrangement echoing that of the central, portrait scroll.

The artist did the “original version” of this triptych in 1988 in fulfillment of requirements for his bachelor of arts degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The artist sold the Mao portrait from that set to Kingsley Liu, a Hong Kong collector of contemporary Chinese ink paintings; the artist still owns the two landscapes from the original set. The artist originally was thinking of simply painting a new Mao portrait, which he would pair with the existing, original landscape paintings (from 1988) for this set (which was commissioned twenty years after the original set; however, upon re-examining the landscape scrolls, which had been stored in Hong Kong, the artist discovered that they sustained water damaged while stored. Thus, the artist created an entirely new set in 2009.

The artist has stated that although this work is a triptych and although he would prefer that the scrolls be exhibited as a set, in fact, the scrolls may be exhibited in whichever arrangement or grouping that curators would like; thus, the scrolls may be shown individually, just as the two landscape scrolls may be exhibited as a pair (without the central portrait of Mao).

","painting proper: 48.9 x 74.5 cm (19 1/4 x 29 5/16 in.)
with mounting: 64.2 x 104.5 cm (25 1/4 x 41 1/8 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"An album leaf, this painting depicts a thatched-roof cottage set in a lush landscape. The cottage sits at the very center of the composition, nestled between a small lake in the foreground and a series of rolling hills in the background and flanked on either side by groves of trees. Grasses and short bamboo plants surround the lake, in which various insects swim. A small, tile-roofed building appears to the (viewer's) left of the cottage, and vegetables grow in a garden to the left of the tile-roofed building. A clump of bamboo grows behind the thatched-roofed cottage. The trees to the right of the cottage are identified as cypresses and pines; those at the left of the composition are unidentified. Written in his own idiosyncratic Roman letters, the artist's signature reading Xu Bing appears in the lower right corner of the composition. The artist impressed his circular, red, relief seal immediately above his signature; the seal, also in his own idiosyncratic Roman letters, reads ""Xu Bing"".

Xu Bing has coined the English word ""Landscript"" to describe his landscapes of this type; the proper Chinese translation is 文字寫生 (""wenzi xiesheng""), though it sometimes also is translated as 讀風景 (""dufengjing""). Landscapes of this type use Chinese characters as pictorial elements, the characters varying from standard script (""kaishu"") and draft script (""caoshu"") to simplified forms as well as such archaic forms as bronze and oracle-bone scripts. Thus, the doorways of both thatched-roof cottage and tile-roofed building are represented with the character meaning ""door"" (""men""), just as the windows in the thatched-roof cottage are represented with the character for window (""chuang""). The various characters incorporated into the composition can be identified as follows:

Doors: ""men"" 門 (door, doorway, gate);
Windows: ""chuang"" 窗 (window, portal);
Thatched roof: ""cao"" 草 (grass);
Tile roof: ""wa"" 瓦 (rooftile);
Beans: ""douzi "" 豆子 (bean)--the plants in the lower right corner, in front of the lake;
Bamboo: ""zhu"" 竹  (bamboo)--the plants in the lower left corner and behind the thatched-roof cottage;
Insects: ""chong"" 虫 (insects, bugs, worms)--the tadpole-like animals in the lake;
Soil: ""tu"" 土 (earth, soil)--the characters to the right of the lake and at the top center of the composition;
Vegetables: ""cai"" 菜 (vegetables)--the plants in the garden to the left of the tile-roofed building;
Trees: ""mu"" 木 (trees, wood)--the trees at the left of the composition, to the left of the vegetable garden;
Grove: ""lin"" 林 (copse, grove, woods, forest)--the trees at the left of the composition, to the left of the vegetable garden;
Leaves: ""yezi"" 葉子 (leaves)--the trees in the upper left corner of the composition, above the ""mu"" and ""lin"" characters; because the trees are far away, one sees only the trees' crowns (i.e. leaves), rather than the trunks and branches;
Cypress: ""bo"" or ""bai"" 柏 (cypress tree)--the trees to the right of the thatched cottage;
Pine: ""song"" 松 (pine tree)--the trees at the right edge of the composition.

Xu Bing's artistic practice is an exploration of language. In works ranging from monumental installations to handcrafted books, he plays with the written word, usually in the form of the Chinese character. Working in a wide range of media, Xu Bing creates installations that question the idea of communicating meaning through language, demonstrating how both meanings and written words can be easily manipulated. In fact, in awarding his 1999 ""genius grant,"" the MacArthur Foundation cited his ""originality, creativity, self-direction, and capacity to contribute importantly to society, particularly in printmaking and calligraphy."" In playing with Chinese characters, Xu Bing typically explores the relationship between word and image--that is, the close relationship between painting and Chinese characters of a pictorial or semi-pictorial type, as he does in this and other paintings in the ""Landscript"" series.

","painting: H. 24.5 x W. 320.3 cm (9 5/8 x 126 1/8 in.)
mounting: H. 25.4 cm (10 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"Painted on paper in ink and the relatively light shades of color that the literati painters of the Suzhou-based Wu School typically employed, this long handscroll presents a panoramic view of trees and mountains along a waterway.  Although rocks, trees, and mountains dominate the scene, tiny figures appear throughout the landscape, crossing bridges, inhabiting village dwellings, and fishing from small boats.  At the end of the scroll, the painting is dated and signed by the artist Wen Zhengming (1470-1559), an important literati painter from Suzhou and a leading figure of the Wu School. A colophon by the Qing scholar Weng Tonghe (1830-1904) follows the painting and comments on the artist's great skill in capturing the essence of past masters while still exhibiting his individualistic style and the meticulous brushwork for which Wen Zhengming was renowned. (A notable Chinese statesman who served as Prime Minister of China, Weng Tonghe was not only a collector and connoisseur but Wan-go H.C. Weng's great-great-grandfather. The colophon and seal indicate that Weng Tonghe collected this scroll, likely in the mid- to late nineteenth century. The scroll, along with the entire collection, remained in the Weng Family through succeeding generations, until the collection was inherited by the infant Wan-go H.C. Weng in 1919.)",Paintings,2010.0,Gift
337418,Pavilion by a Waterfall and Stream,Korean,"Chosŏn dynasty, 1392-1910",19th century,"Album leaf; ink and light color on paper; with artist inscription and square, red, relief artist seal reading ""So Ch’i""","Painting proper: H. 21 x W. 36.7 cm (8 1/4 x 14 7/16 in.)
Mounting: H. 23.7 x W. 36.8 cm (9 5/16 x 14 1/2 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"Painted in ink and light colors on paper, this rectangular album leaf depicts an autumnal landscape with a scholar seated in a riverside pavilion. Set on stilts that elevate it above the waters, the thatched pavilion is situated between the river and a mountain down whose sides cascades a waterfall, its waters flowing under the pavilion and into the river. The scholar gazes toward the composition’s left edge, which is dominated by the river and the distant mountains, whose details are completely obscured by the intervening mists, which impart a light blue hue. The thatched pavilion appears at the bottom of the painting, in the center foreground. A series of tree-capped hillocks arcs from the composition’s lower right corner to the composition’s center, framing the multi-room pavilion. A tall peak with craggy, vertical sides and plateaus at its top dominates the right half of the composition. The waterfall tumbles down the front of the dominant peak, falling into an unseen stream that flows to the foreground, under the pavilion, and into the lake. The artist’s short, vertically oriented, four-character inscription reading ""Bi Ryu Kye Kak"" (Chinese, ""Fei Liu Xi Ge"") appears in the upper left corner of the painting; the inscription can be loosely translated as “Pavilion by a Waterfall and Stream.” The artist’s rectangular, red, relief seal reading ""So Ch’i"" (Chinese, ""Xiao Chi"") appears immediately to the (viewer’s) left of the inscription’s lower two characters.

The artist’s inscription/title, particularly the characters ""Bi Ryu"" (Chinese ""Fei Liu""), which Ho Ryon used to mean “waterfall,” suggests that the scene might well have been inspired by the Chinese poem “Gazing at the Waterfall on Mt. Lu” (Chinese ""Wang Lu Shan Pu Bu""), which was composed by the Tang-dynasty poet Li Bai (701-762):

Gazing at the Waterfall on Mt. Lu (Censer Mountain)
By Li Bai 

The mists enveloping Censer Mountain (Mt. Lu) shimmer violet in the sunshine.
The distant waterfall recalls a river hanging from the sky,
Its flying waters cascading straight down from three thousand feet up.
Is it the Milky Way tumbling from the highest heavens, star by star?


Despite its likely literary reference to a poem of Li Bai, the painting’s style derives from that of the Qing-dynasty Orthodox-school masters Wang Hui (1632-1717) and Wang Yuanqi (1642-1715). The portrayal of the scholar and of the thatched pavilion recalls the works of the Ming literati painter Shen Zhou (1427-1509).

The young maharaja is seated in durbar on a low, red upholstered throne with scrolling arms and backrest.  Richly dressed in jewels and a green garment, he is flanked by ten courtiers, all dressed in white robes seated with legs akimbo. An attendant stands behind the maharaja lofting a floral standard or fan.  All twelve figures are rendered in strict profile, but the maharaja is distinguished by a green nimbus ringed in gold.   Each courtier has before him a plate holding drinks and ""pan"", while the maharaja holds a sprig of flowers.  

Rendered in imperfect single point perspective, the hall has pink walls that are pierced on one side by horseshoe arches that open to a cloud-filled sky.  The floor is checkered in blue and white tiles and the black ceiling is painted in gold foliate patterns.  Three grand chandeliers of European design hang from the ceiling and matching sconces are affixed to the walls and pillars.  Large mirrors framed in green occupy the back and side walls.

frame: H. 75 x W. 344 cm (29 1/2 x 135 7/16 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"Painted in ink on silk, this long, rectangular wall scroll depicts a summer landscape after rain. The painting, which occupies roughly four-fifths of the silk ground, is followed by the artist’s long inscription in standard-script characters (kaishu), which occupies the remaining one fifth of the silk ground. Clinging closely to the picture plane, the landscape, which reads from right to left, in traditional Chinese fashion, includes foreground hillocks and a wall of background mountains, the two separated by a mist-enshrouded valley. The scene opens with a tree-covered hillock; a path, or small bridge, is visible in the cleft that divides the hillock into two; a small waterfall tumbles down the face of the hillock’s larger segment. Distance and obscuring mists reduce the distant mountains to sheer cliffs and overlapping planes that recall those of the monumental mountain in the quintessential Northern Song (960–1279) landscape painting Travelers among Mountains and Streams by Fan Kuan (fl. 990–1020), now in the collection of the National Palace Museum, Taipei. Towering pines grow in the space between the first hillock and the long second one; that space also affords a view of the base of the distant mountains and also of the stream that flows through the valley that separates foreground and background elements. Set on a distant hill at the base of the tall, background mountains, a cluster of buildings—perhaps a temple, an estate, or even a village—is faintly visible through the mists and above those pines that rise near the right end of the second foreground hillock. Farther to the left, a mountain rises from the center of the second hillock, its form and “moss dots” echoing those of the distant mountains, thus linking foreground and background and unifying the composition. A gap between the left edge of the second hillock and the foreground mountain at the composition’s left edge permits a view of the waterfall that tumbles down the side of a distant mountain and that is perhaps the source of the river that flows through the valley. Just as the path, or small bridge, at the beginning of the painting invites the viewer to enter the composition, the tall mountains at the end, which recede from foreground to background, bring the composition to a close. The artist’s long inscription follows the painting and is written on the same stretch of silk as the painting itself. Comprising 1072 characters written in standard script (kaishu), the inscription is arranged in thirty seven columns of twenty nine characters each (except for the last column—i.e., the column at the far left—which includes just twenty eight characters, the twenty ninth space being left for the artist’s seal). The artist’s dated signature comprises the last five characters of the inscription and reads ""xinmao Xiangzhou zhi"", which can be translated as “…done [by] Xiangzhou [in the] xinmao [year].”  Note that the xingmao year corresponds to 2011 in the Gregorian calendar. The artist’s square, red, intaglio seal impression reading ""Xiang Zhou"" appears in the lower left corner of the work, immediately following the artist’s signature. The painting was silk-matted in Beijing; it was framed in New York, following the frame style that The Chinese Porcelain  Company uses for Tai Xiangzhou’s works, The Chinese Porcelain Company being the New York gallery that represents Tai Xiangzhou in the U.S.",Paintings,2012.0,Gift

342698,"Ten Thousand Years, Ten Thousand Years of Sleep, One Hundred Million Scattered Pieces",Chinese,,21st century,"A set of three hanging scrolls forming a triptych; ink on paper; with artist's signature reading ""Erlinglingjiu nian chun Li Junyi shi yu Meiguo Fenghuangcheng""",Overall: H. 288 x W. 285.7 cm (113 3/8 x 112 1/2 in.),Department of Asian Art,"This triptych comprises a set of three hanging scrolls, each painted in ink on paper. The central scroll is a formal portrait of Mao Zedong (1893–1976); the flanking scrolls represent landscapes. The Mao portrait is based both on the official portrait photograph of Mao Zedong that was taken in 1959 by Xinhua News Agency photojournalists Meng Qingbiao (1925–1969) and Ho Bo (born 1924) and on the official portrait painting of Chairman Mao that that was created in 1959 by Zhang Zhenshi (1914–1992), a professor at the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, Beijing, based on the official portrait photograph. The portrait presents a bust-length, frontal portrait of Chairman Mao, his head and shoulders turned slightly, almost imperceptibly, to his proper right. His hair is combed straight back, his eyes are fully open, and his mouth suggests a slight smile. He wears a Mao jacket, buttoned all the way to the top; one circular button appears in the inverted “V” formed by the two downward-projecting points of the collar. Perhaps part of the Mao-jacket collar, perhaps the top of a collar of a shirt worn under the jacket, a slender white line encircles Chairman Mao’s neck, readily distinguishing garment from flesh. A circular black disc appears in the center of the otherwise unembellished white paper above Chairman Mao’s head. The background area of the portrait—but not the area above the portrait—are fully textured, so that the image of Chairman Mao emerges from a gray background. The characters that appear throughout the painting, both in the portrait of Chairman Mao and in the disc above—i.e., one character within each square of the grid—read Mao Ze Dong; arranged in random order, they also appear in random orientations, some right side up, others upside down, and yet others sideways. The “texturing characters” appear in the image of Mao, in the background areas, and in the disc above but are most evident in the background areas and in the disc. A long inscription comprising 180 characters appears in the rectangular border surrounding the painting. A narrow strip of unembellished white paper appears just inside the border, clearly differentiating border from portrait.

Each landscape scroll presents a view into a deep mountain valley that recedes distantly into the pictorial space. Each landscape is a bilaterally symmetrical rendition of the other, so that the landscapes are mirror images of each other. Appearing black and positioned at the “inside edge” of each landscape composition—i.e., on the side of the composition opposite from the blank grid square that is an “implied seal” (see description below)—a towering foreground peak partially blocks the view of the mountain range that rises on one side of the valley. Silhouetted against the receding valley, old pines grow around the periphery of the foreground peak and around the top of the shorter peak that accompanies it. When the landscape scrolls are hung on either side of the central scroll, the dark, foreground peaks frame the Mao portrait. A rectangular area of blank paper appears above each landscape, and a dark border frames each composition and the accompanying blank paper above, a narrow strip of unembellished white paper separating border from landscape, the arrangement echoing that of the central, portrait scroll.

The artist did the “original version” of this triptych in 1988 in fulfillment of requirements for his bachelor of arts degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The artist sold the Mao portrait from that set to Kingsley Liu, a Hong Kong collector of contemporary Chinese ink paintings; the artist still owns the two landscapes from the original set. The artist originally was thinking of simply painting a new Mao portrait, which he would pair with the existing, original landscape paintings (from 1988) for this set (which was commissioned twenty years after the original set; however, upon re-examining the landscape scrolls, which had been stored in Hong Kong, the artist discovered that they sustained water damaged while stored. Thus, the artist created an entirely new set in 2009.

The artist has stated that although this work is a triptych and although he would prefer that the scrolls be exhibited as a set, in fact, the scrolls may be exhibited in whichever arrangement or grouping that curators would like; thus, the scrolls may be shown individually, just as the two landscape scrolls may be exhibited as a pair (without the central portrait of Mao).

",Department of Asian Art,"Painted with ink and colored pigments on paper, this magnificent eight-panel folding screen boasts a continuous scene of a lotus pond with tall, luxuriant stalks of lotus flowers, buds, and leaves interspersed with pairs of birds, fish, and other aquatic creatures. Each individual panel depicts clusters of lotus plants emerging from the bottom of a pond – white lotus blossoms and buds, their petals tinged with a touch of pink at the tips, are shown in various stages of growth atop long, thin stems; large, broad lotus leaves painted in rich hues of blue, green, or golden brown turn and curl in every direction. Each panel also includes at least one pair of birds or fish: Mandarin ducks, magpies, and kingfishers fly above or perch on the lotuses; waterfowl, fish, and a crab and shrimp appear below, as if standing in or lying beneath the water of the pond. Although the vertical panels may be viewed somewhat satisfyingly as individual compositions, the continuous lotus imagery elegantly undulates across each panel to create a visually stunning panorama.

This decorated screen is rife with auspicious symbolism. Wishes for marital bliss are conveyed by the pairs of birds and fish, while individual animals such as the crab, magpie, and shrimp, whose names in Chinese and Korean are reminiscent of words of good fortune, represent wishes for a life full of harmony, happiness, longevity, and prosperity. Whereas in the Buddhist and Confucian traditions, the lotus is an emblem of purity and the upright Confucian scholar, in the folk art tradition, the lotus pod’s abundance of seeds signify fecundity, and the word for lotus in both Chinese and Korean (Ch. lian, K. yŏn) is homonymous with the word for “continuity,” thereby suggesting a wish for the continuation of the family through the birth of many sons.

Painted folded screens were displayed in the rooms of virtually every household in Chosŏn-period Korea, from the royal palace to the homes of aristocratic government officials and commoners. As functioning pieces of furniture, screens divided rooms, provided privacy, and deflected drafts. As works of folk art, they decorated a living space and offered hope for good fortune through their auspicious symbolism. The elegant composition, skillful painting, rich materials, and relatively tall proportions of this screen of lotuses and birds suggest that it was likely commissioned by a relatively wealthy patron for an upper class residence.",Paintings,2013.0,Purchase

In this painting, the female figure sits on an outcropping of lilac-colored rocks, between two silvery bodies of water. She plays a pungi, a type of wind instrument, to charm the snakes. The snakes spiraling down the tree and coiling around the figure’s limbs.
Contrary to the stereotypical presentation of Asavari Ragini as a dark-skinned tribal woman garbed in leaves or feathers, she appears in this painting as fair-haired and fashionably dressed, with fingertips colored by henna.  Her upswept topknot signals that she should be viewed as a yogini—a woman who follows the Hindu ascetic path.  Conventionally, Asavari Ragini is a solitary figure, but here she is accompanied by a semi-clad ascetic, who stands at left.  The standing ascetic is attended by a dog and holds a fan and a meditation crutch, all of which symbolize that the devotee is of the ascetic Nath order. This painting is a pictorial metaphor for a raga, a musical phrase that is used as the basis for improvisation). Deccan.

Each panel of the screen contains a composition of two slightly angled stacks of Chinese-style bound books surrounded by a variety of scholarly paraphernalia, including antique vessels, spectacles with an accompanying case, and so-called “Four Friends of the Scholar – a calligraphy brush, ink stick, inkstone, and rolls of paper. Painted in ink and bright colors on a plain, colorless silk ground, some objects appear to be floating in space, whereas others appear to rest atop the stacks of books, which provide the overall composition some semblance of three-dimensional space.

 A well-known Confucian subject known in Korean as Ch’aekkŏri, or “books and things,” such paintings are still-life compositions of items with which the ideal Confucian scholar surrounded himself in his studio. Although the subject originated in China, by the late eighteenth century the royal court in Korea began to commission Ch’aekkŏri paintings to display behind desks in men’s quarters. In the nineteenth century such paintings became widely popular decorative items among the gentry class, for these paintings conveyed an air of dignity, luxury, and reverence for scholarship. They were also used in the households of commoners who appreciated, but usually could not afford, the luxury goods illustrated in the paintings. The essential elements of any Ch’aekkŏri painting are the scholar’s items, but as the theme became popularized, fruits, flowers, and other objects symbolic of prosperity, fecundity, and longevity made their way into the compositions. Ch’aekkŏri thus also functioned as talismans, since they promoted virtue and harmony in the household, just as the practice of Confucian moral conduct by persons of all classes was believed to ensure harmony in the state.

H. 57 x W. 45 cm (22 7/16 x 17 11/16 in.),Department of Asian Art,"The central figure in this Tibetan Buddhist painting, or thangka, is Bhaisajyaguru—the buddha of healing and medicine known more commonly as the Medicine Buddha. Seated on an elaborate lotus throne in traditional vajrasana position (with legs crossed, right foot over left), this dark-blue skinned Buddha grasps a myrobalan fruit (emblematic of healing) in his proper right hand; his left hand supports a begging bowl and rests on his lap in dhayanamudra position. He is flanked by two standing bodhisattvas – the red-skinned Suryabhaskara (with an emblem of the sun atop a lotus) to his proper right and the white-skinned Chandrabhaskara (with an emblem of the moon) to his proper left. Stupas containing the Five Symbolic Buddhas—including the historical Buddha Shakyamuni at the top center—sit on a tiered dais behind the main figure. The other figures that surround this assemblage in orderly rows and columns include: the eight emanations of the Medicine Buddha and the female Prajnaparamita, the Sixteen Bodhisattvas, the Sixteen Great Elders or arhats, the Ten Worldly Gods, the Twelve Yaksha Generals, the Guardian Kings of the Four Directions, and depictions of Tibetan Kings, teachers, and attendant figures.  On the back of the painting, an image of a stupa is drawn in black ink, the stupa’s proportions and position corresponding to the composition of the main seated Medicine Buddha figure on the front. Within the stupa, three inscriptions written with the Tibetan alphabet appear: two in Sanskrit language, one in Tibetan language. A three-syllable mantra written in Tibetan script is repeatedly inscribed along the periphery of the stupa, each positioned to correspond to the placement of one of the surrounding figures (ie., the bodhisattvas, arhats, yakshas, etc.) depicted on the front. These inscriptions evoked and “installed” the spirit of the deity or historical person into the painting, thereby consecrating the thangka. Probably from Tsang province, Central Tibet (U-tsang).",Paintings,2014.0,Gift

She wears a collared red kaftan, the right hem of which is tucked into a low-slung golden belt. The kaftan is loosely fastened at the bust to reveal a low décolletage. A gossamer fabric serves for flaring sleeves and a gold-edged skirt, beneath which appear billowing trousers patterned with floral designs. Her headgear consists of an upward-tapered hotoz sheathed in gold fabric, held in place with a headscarf or sarık edged with gold beads. Her costume is completed with teardrop earrings, gold bracelets, and yellow çedik on posed feet, all signaling high status. She stands on a balcony with European-style balustrades overlooking the Bosphorus from Üsküdar on the Asian side of Istanbul. In the distance, beyond her left hand proper, stands the Maiden’s Tower as it appeared before it was rebuilt in the early 19th century. Directly below her hand, on the Üsküdar shore, can be seen a minaret, a lead-clad dome, and brick buildings which likely represent the Atik Valide mosque-madrasa complex.

The eye is led into the hermitage via the pathway at the right hand side. As one approaches the soft-focus landscape periodically resolves into crisply descriptive highlights: a round straw hat hanging by the doorway, books and a rosary set within the resident’s studio, a crescent moon-shaped decoration cut into the wood of the shutter at far left, and the russet tips of a smattering of autumnal leaves in the garden. A slim tree trunk speckled with verdigris lichens rises up just right of center in the left screen; its elliptical leathery leaves arch down over the roof of the studio in the top center of the right screen, almost puncturing the fourth wall. The leaves that entreat us to enter are distinctive, identifiable as those of the persimmon and thus a key to the identity of the tranquil location depicted: we have come to the “Rakushisha” 落柿舎 or Hermitage of Fallen Persimmons.",Paintings,2021.0,Purchase

Skilled at landscape depictions but best known for his representations of oxen, Kim Sik came from a prominent family of painters and was the grandnephew of Kim Che (active 1540), one of sixteenth-century Korea's most famous painters of birds and flowers. The genre of bird-and-flower painting arose in China during the Northern Song period (960-1127) and remained popular through succeeding dynasties; it spread to Korea early in the Chosŏn (1392-1911) dynasty and to Japan in the Muromachi period (1392-1568). Chinese painters tended to depict birds in color, while Korean and Japanese artists preferred to render them in monochrome ink.

Native to China, roses appear only occasionally in Chinese paintings; by contrast, they occur with some frequency in Korean and Japanese works. Gold-flecked paper enjoyed a measure of popularity among Chinese literati artists of the late Ming (1368-1644) and early Qing (1644-1911) periods; it sparked interest among Korean painters of the mid-Chosŏn period and claimed widespread popularity by the nineteenth century.

Skilled at landscape depictions but best known for his representations of oxen, Kim Sik came from a prominent family of painters and was the grandnephew of Kim Che (active 1540), one of sixteenth-century Korea's most famous painters of birds and flowers. The genre of bird-and-flower painting arose in China during the Northern Song period (960-1127) and remained popular through succeeding dynasties; it spread to Korea early in the Chosŏn (1392-1911) dynasty and to Japan in the Muromachi period (1392-1568). Chinese painters tended to depict birds in color, while Korean and Japanese artists preferred to render them in monochrome ink.

mounting, with cord and roller ends: H. 176.5 x W. 76.2 cm (69 1/2 x 30 in.)",Department of Asian Art,"Sugawara Michizane (845-903) was a brilliant Chinese literary scholar and statesman during Japan's Heian period (794-1185) who rose quickly to high courtly rank but was unjustly exiled after an alleged plot against the emperor. Banished to the southern island of Kyushu in 901, Michizane never sought to challenge the will of the ruler who doubted his loyalty, and he died two years later after much suffering. Soon thereafter, a series of natural disasters racked the city of Kyoto and were attributed to the vengeful spirit of the wronged man. In order to appease his ghost, Michizane was posthumously appointed to high political office and eventually deified as Kitano Tenjin--""Heavenly Deity of the Northern Fields""--protector of the capital and patron spirit of poetry and calligraphy. The main center of his cult is the Kitano Tenjin Shrine in Kyoto, with branch shrines throughout the nation. Idealized portraits of Michizane are displayed each year on August 4th, the anniversary of his death, and poetry readings and calligraphy contests are held at his shrines. In this scroll the deity is depicted as a distinguished older gentleman wearing Japanese court robes and flanked by paintings of pine and plum--plants with long-standing Chinese literary associations. Michizane is famous for his devotion to a particular plum tree in his Kyoto garden to which he addressed his most famous poetic lament on the occasion of his exile:

If the east wind blows this way,
Oh blossoms on the plum tree,
Send your fragrance to me!
Always be mindful of the spring,
Even though your master is no longer there!

This faithful plum tree is said to have uprooted itself and flown to Kyushu in order to be with Michizane. In honor of its loyalty, plum trees are planted on the grounds of every Tenjin shrine.
